# Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) Solver

- [ode.py](https://github.com/hsuanhao/Library/blob/master/ODE/ode.py) is the self-written library including different solvers to solve ODEs. (For the time being, there's only Euler algorithm.)

- [Solve_ODE_by_Euler_Algorithm.ipynb](https://github.com/hsuanhao/Library/blob/master/ODE/Solve_ODE_by_Euler_Algorithm.ipynb) is the documentation about implementation of Euler algorithm to solve ODEs.
